We try to have physical meetings at least once a year during OW2 or Open Source events (OW2Con, SolutionsLinux, OWF, ...). We use IRC for other monthly meetings and more generally to keep contact and exchange our thoughts.

### IRC instructions

- **Server : ** irc.freenode.net
- **Channel : ** \#ow2-tc
- **Password : ** jetstream
